Comprehensive Machine Learning Full Pipeline
on Heart Disease UCI Dataset
1. General Description of the Task:
This project aims to analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks using machine
learning. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality
reduction (PCA), model training, evaluation, and deployment. Classification models like
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM will be used, alongside
K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for unsupervised learning. Additionally, a Streamlit UI
will be built for user interaction, deployed via Ngrok, and the project will be hosted on GitHub.
1.1 Objectives:
● Perform Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (handle missing values, encoding, scaling).
● Apply Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) to retain essential features.
● Implement Feature Selection using statistical methods and ML-based techniques.
● Train Supervised Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random
Forest, SVM) for classification.
● Apply Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for pattern discovery.
● Optimize Models using Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV,
RandomizedSearchCV).
● Deploy a Streamlit UI for real-time user interaction. [Bonus]
● Host the application using Ngrok [Bonus] and upload the project to GitHub for
accessibility.
